# Port-fidelity audit — orchestration tracker

Systematic, area-by-area audit of the HexCombat port against **TaiwanInvasionViewer** (TIV,
`C:\Users\mdogg\TaiwanInvasionViewer\TaiwanInvasionViewer`). Goal: every system is (1) documented
for machines (`docs/systems/<area>.md`, indexed from `AGENTS.md`), (2) documented for humans
(`docs/systems/html/<area>.html`), and (3) compared to its TIV oracle, with discrepancies either
fixed (obvious) or flagged in `/DECISIONS.md` (design calls).

## Per-area loop
1. **Document (opencode):** read HexCombat code → write `docs/systems/<area>.md` + `.../html/<area>.html`.
2. **Compare (opencode, read-only against TIV):** diff behavior vs. the TIV oracle → discrepancy list.
3. **Adjudicate (orchestrator):** independently verify against real source → fix obvious gaps, or
   add a `/DECISIONS.md` entry. Update STATUS/port_audit as needed. Commit.

> **Open design calls so far** (`/DECISIONS.md`): Area 2 — (1) unit strength table differs from TIV on
> 12/17 types (recommend keep HexCombat's); (2) `feba_base_km` 2.0 vs TIV 3.5 (recommend configurable).
> Both await user ratification; not yet actioned.

## Log
<!-- one line per completed step: area#, step, outcome, commit -->
- Area 1 — documented (`docs/systems/hex-grid.md` + html) and compared. **Finding:** confirmed
  coordinate-system bug — `HexMath` treated offset (odd-r) coords as axial; neighbors matched geography
  23/308 vs odd-r 308/308. **Resolved (user call): FIXED** — odd-r neighbors + offset→cube distance;
  scenario beach-1 green + fixtures + LLM docs updated; golden re-baselined to `casualties=3,
  feba=-0.55`; full gate ALL PHASES GREEN. See `/DECISIONS.md` + `PLAN.md` Decisions (2026-06-29).
- Area 2 — documented (`docs/systems/ground-combat.md` + html) and compared vs
  `boots_calculator.py::resolve_map_attack`. **Core formula is a near-exact port** (clamps, FEBA,
  casualty rules all match). **Findings (2 design calls → `/DECISIONS.md`):** (1) unit strength table
  differs on 12/17 types — HexCombat differentiates, TIV's runtime flattens maneuver units to 1.0 (TIV
  mapping bug); HexCombat ported the intent; (2) `feba_base_km` 2.0 vs TIV 3.5. Minor notes (in the
  doc): RNG algorithm differs (numpy vs Dice → self-consistent only); `combat_detail` key shape. No
  code changed — both findings await user ratification.
- Area 3 — documented (`docs/systems/amphibious-offload.md` + html) and compared vs
  `offload_calculator.py` / `beach_throughput.py`. **✅ Faithful port** — verified `TONS_PER_BN=2200`,
  the pier/barge throughput formula, and the maneuver-BN whitelist all match TIV exactly; day-1
  redesign mirrored by 54 GdUnit tests. Only minor intentional `ShipLoadingModel` simplifications
  (per-type transport weight; amphibious-vs-cargo ship eligibility) diverge — already code-documented.
  No DECISIONS, no code change.
- Area 4 — documented (`docs/systems/supply-dos.md` + html) and compared vs `red_dos_consumption.py`.
  **✅ Faithful port** — constants (300/150/150), activity formula, mechanized hints, and the
  consumption-summary/net-delta (conservative ceil) all match TIV exactly. **One port gap (→
  `port_audit.md`):** `supply_effectiveness` is computed but fed to combat as a hardcoded 1.0
  (`CombatForces.gd:20`), so supply has no combat effect yet (TIV injects real values). No code change.
  NB: opencode agents default to the WRONG TIV path (outer dir) — pass the nested
  `…/TaiwanInvasionViewer/TaiwanInvasionViewer/…` path explicitly.
- Area 5 — documented (`docs/systems/antiship-mine.md` + html) and compared. **✅ Faithful ports from
  TWO source repos:** missile crossing/firing-plan/launch-attrition/magazine port TIV `antiship_*.py`
  stage-for-stage (verified); the geometric **mine model ports `TaiwanDefenseRefactor/mine_warfare.py`**
  (verified functions exist), NOT TIV's own sweep-based mine service — a deliberate cross-repo choice.
  Corrected the agent's draft (it had been mis-told the mine model was HexCombat-original). No new
  DECISIONS — count-based-vs-per-hull, per-category neutralization, magazine persistence already logged.
- Area 6 — documented (`docs/systems/ijfs.md` + html) and compared vs `src/ijfs_standalone/*`.
  **✅ Faithful port** — 10/11 stages are 1:1 (detection, targeting, engagement, strike Pk+resolution,
  firing capacity, AD health, warmup, loaders, daily state, run context); orchestrator independently
  confirmed pipeline order + strike-probability model. One adaptation (anti-ship targets from
  pre-built containers vs SQLite default_targets). **Port gap (→ `port_audit.md`):** ground
  (`maneuver_casualties`) writeback is computed but (a) empty at runtime — IJFS targets lack OOB
  battalion IDs — and (b) not consumed; IJFS air/missile kills don't reduce ground brigades. Anti-ship
  half IS wired. No new DECISIONS.
- Area 7 — documented (`docs/systems/frontline-cleanup-victory.md` + html) and compared. **✅ Front-line
  & cleanup are faithful ports** (polyline→hex 2km sampling, arc-length interpolation, ownership
  recompute all match `front_line_service.py`/`cleanup_hex_service.py`, verified). **Victory is
  HexCombat-original** (no TIV BOOTS equivalent; settled 2026-06-28). REFINE (→ `port_audit.md`):
  front-line distribution is brigade-level vs TIV battalion-level + per-hex clipping; tied to the
  deferred draw UI (Track 5). taiwan_hexes=null census caveat is known. No new DECISIONS.
- Area 8 — documented (`docs/systems/turn-engine.md` + html). **Adaptation, not a 1:1 port** (correctly):
  WeGo plan→resolve + Godot autoloads + seeded `Dice` reimagine TIV's Flask/SQLite phase model, keeping
  the same phase order (IJFS→antiship→offload→movement→combat→cleanup). `resolve_turn` stage order
  verified against STATUS. HexCombat-original: the WeGo order layer, `play_turn`/`TurnResult` AI
  entrypoint, determinism enforcement (`validate_no_global_rng`). No discrepancies / no DECISIONS.
- Area 9 — documented (`docs/systems/llm-api-selfplay.md` + html). **HexCombat-original** (TIV has no
  agent API). Observation/action contracts + self-play harness; cross-links the existing LLM design
  docs. No TIV comparison applicable. No DECISIONS.
- Area 10 — documented (`docs/systems/view-layer.md` + html). **HexCombat-original** Godot view (TIV
  was Flask/HTML/JS). Rendering/input/panels/NATO symbols. Track 5 graphics items pending (visual, not
  headless-gateable). No DECISIONS.

## ✅ AUDIT COMPLETE — all 10 areas documented (md + html), compared, and adjudicated (2026-06-29)
**Net outcome:** 1 foundational bug found & fixed (Area 1 hex coords, golden re-baselined); 2 design
calls awaiting user ratification (`/DECISIONS.md`: combat strength table 12/17 types; `feba_base` 2.0
vs 3.5); port-completeness items logged in `port_audit.md` (supply→combat link, IJFS→ground casualties,
ship-loading + front-line simplifications, per-hull magazines, missile-pipeline depth). Everything else
verified faithful to the TIV / TaiwanDefenseRefactor oracles. Full gate green throughout.
