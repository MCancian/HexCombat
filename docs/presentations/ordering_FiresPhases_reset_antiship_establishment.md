# Ordering: `FiresPhases.reset_antiship_establishment`

> **Reading aid, not an execution contract.** No detected edge is not permission to reorder.
> GDScript reads and writes are conservative source analysis; transition writes are also
> checked against the mutation manifest. Potential conflicts may refer to different object
> instances or conditional branches.

## Lexical call-site map (CALL edges)

> Source order is not an execution count: loop calls repeat, branch calls may be skipped
> or mutually exclusive, and nested arguments execute before their outer call.

## State and RNG constraints

| Earlier node | Later node | Kinds | Shared evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| _No constraint edge resolved_ | | | This is not evidence that calls are reorderable. |

## Detected campaign-state/RNG overview

This compact diagram shows up to 40 detected RAW/WAR/WAW/RNG constraints involving protected
campaign fields. The table above remains the complete conservative evidence.
