# HexCombat — plans index

Work orders for multi-session efforts. Each plan is a focused doc; **this index is the source
of truth** for status. Status vocabulary: `Sketch` → `Exploring` → `In progress` → `✅ Shipped`
→ `Superseded`.

**Plans are ephemeral by contract.** A plan holds the design, the checklist, and progress notes
*while the work is in flight*. It is not a reference: no durable fact may live only in a plan.

**Closeout rule** (enforced by `hexcombat-change-control` / `hexcombat-docs-and-writing`):
a plan is done only when its durable facts have landed in their canonical homes —
`docs/systems/<module>.md` updated, `docs/STATUS.md` bullet current, `hexcombat-failure-archaeology`
entry if there was an incident, a 3–5-line `docs/DECISIONS.md` entry — and the plan file gets a
3-line closeout header and moves to `docs/archive/`. If a future agent would need to read the
plan to act, the closeout wasn't done.

## Active

| # | Plan | Priority | Status |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| 0001 | [Crossing-lethality calibration (D3-D)](0001-crossing-lethality-calibration.md) | High (blocks balance claims) | Exploring |
| 0002 | [Per-hull escort magazines (D3-B3)](0002-per-hull-escort-magazines.md) | Low (needs ship-ammo subsystem) | Sketch |

## Track-level forward work

See [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) — live tracks only (completed tracks live in `docs/STATUS.md` as
present-tense behavior, history in `docs/archive/`).

## Parked refinements (no plan until a concrete need)

One-liners; detail in `docs/archive/port_audit.md`:
- Flotilla composition nuances (unit of allocation for the missile pipeline — only with 0001).
- Front-line distribution at battalion granularity (with the D5-D draw UI, Track D).
- ShipLoadingModel per-type transport weight + amphibious-vs-cargo eligibility (exact-manifest
  calibration only).
- Deliberately NOT ported (TIV-specific): SQL/DB writeback, mine same-day re-preview baseline,
  Streamlit dashboards — list in `docs/archive/port_audit.md` §Intentionally skipped.
