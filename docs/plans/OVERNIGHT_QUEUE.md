# Overnight autonomous work queue

Drives the overnight `/loop`. **Orient each iteration:** `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (orchestrator role +
opencode usage), `docs/STATUS.md`, `docs/plans/port_audit.md`. You are the **orchestrator**; implement
via the `opencode` subagent (self-contained plan each time; tell it to follow `AGENTS.md`).

**Autonomy: MAXIMIZE (user-set).** Make reasonable judgment calls to keep moving; record each in
`PLAN.md` → Decisions. Only STOP (write to `/DECISIONS.md` and end the iteration) for a **truly
destructive/irreversible** action or a gate you **can't get green after ~2 focused attempts**. Never
commit `.mcp.json`. **Do NOT touch Track 5 graphics** — it needs visual verification, unsuitable for
unattended work.

## Known gate flakiness (retry policy)
A few `await`-signal GdUnit tests intermittently time out under heavier suite load — they pass in
isolation and on re-run. **Partial hardening DONE 2026-06-29:** the signal asserts in
`movement_ui_test`/`selection_test` now use `.wait_until(5000)` (was the 2s default) so slow-path
timing no longer false-fails. Remaining flakes are rarer pure-test/teardown blips under the full
pipeline (e.g. `supply_combat_effectiveness_test`, `offload_calculator_test`, `symbol_library_test`
is_push_error) — Godot 4.7 teardown pressure, not await timeouts. **Policy:** if `run_all_tests.ps1`
fails only on such a test (passes in isolation, shifts between runs), **re-run once** (twice if needed);
a clean run counts as green. A deterministic failure (same test every run, real assertion) is a real
break — fix it.

## opencode invocation (Windows arg limits)
A long CLI prompt fails with "Argument list too long"; and `-f <file> "<msg>"` makes `--file` (an array)
swallow the message as a second file. **Use:** put the message FIRST, file LAST —
`opencode run -m … --dangerously-skip-permissions "short msg, see attached plan" -f "plan.md"` — or
just implement small/contained sub-tasks directly (faster than fighting the weak model + arg parsing).

## Per-iteration loop
1. Pick the next unchecked queue item below (top to bottom).
2. Implement via `opencode` (read the relevant `docs/systems/*.md` first; preserve ported math unless a
   re-baseline is the explicit point of the task).
3. **Verify yourself:** `pwsh tools/run_all_tests.ps1` → must end **ALL PHASES GREEN**. Review the diff
   for scope drift; exclude unrelated changes.
4. Commit (end message with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>`). Push at milestones.
5. Update docs: `STATUS.md` (present tense, no dates), check the item off here + in `port_audit.md`,
   the relevant `docs/systems/*.md` (+ html mirror), `PLAN.md` → Decisions (why), `RETROSPECTIVES.md`
   (lessons + the opencode retrospective).

## Queue (in priority order)

- [x] **1. Wire `supply_effectiveness` into combat.** ✅ DONE 2026-06-29 — `GameState._inject_supply_effectiveness`; knob `red_out_of_supply_effectiveness`=0.5; tests added; gate green; golden unchanged. (`port_audit.md` "Supply-effectiveness → combat
  link".) Replace the hardcoded `1.0` in `CombatForces.maneuver_units` (`scripts/CombatForces.gd:20`)
  and `UnitManager.gd:31` with the real per-unit supply effectiveness derived from
  `GameState.supply_state` (out-of-supply Red BNs fight at reduced effectiveness, 0..1), mirroring TIV
  `boots_combat_service._inject_supply_effectiveness`. `CombatCalculator` already multiplies strength by
  it. Add a GdUnit test + extend a headless gate. **Re-baseline** the golden invariant if combat values
  shift (record old→new in `PLAN.md` Decisions + `validate_cleanup.gd` + `STATUS.md`).
  *Done when:* a depleted supply pool measurably lowers Red combat strength; gate green.

- [x] **2. Apply IJFS→ground maneuver casualties** — ✅ DONE 2026-06-30 (all sub-tasks). Large
  (Option B + detectability, settled 2026-06-28); split into gateable sub-tasks (orchestrator call 2026-06-29):
  - [x] **2a. Persistent prior-turn activity flags on `Brigade`** ✅ DONE 2026-06-29 —
    `moved_last_turn`/`fought_last_turn` latched in `resolve_cleanup_phase`; `brigade_activity_history_test.gd`;
    gate green; golden unchanged (latch consumes no dice).
  - [x] **2b.** ✅ DONE 2026-06-29 — `IjfsLoaders.build_maneuver_targets(green_brigades)` (pure) mints
    `{brigade_id}-MU-{n}` per battalion instance + `MANEUVER_TYPE_MAP` profile + OOB metadata
    (battalion_id/brigade_id/to_number/unit_type). Added `Brigade.to_number`. `ijfs_maneuver_targets_test.gd`.
    NOT yet wired into the pipeline (2c/2d) → golden unchanged. Gate green.
  - [x] **2c-i.** ✅ DONE 2026-06-29 — wired `build_maneuver_targets` into `GameState._rebuild_ijfs_state`
    (Green maneuver units now enter IJFS detection/targeting/strike via existing "Maneuver Units"
    pairings). `maneuver_casualties` now populates (verified: 3 struck, e.g. `BDE-269-MU-3`). Golden
    UNCHANGED (IJFS strikes maneuver units with leftover budget; anti-ship suppression unperturbed).
  - [x] **2c-ii.** ✅ DONE 2026-06-30 — posture-by-activity bias: `GameState._update_maneuver_posture()`
    (top of `resolve_ijfs_turn`) sets maneuver-unit targets' `posture="active"` when the source brigade
    has `moved_last_turn`/`fought_last_turn` (2a flags), else `"hiding"` — feeding the existing
    `IjfsDetection` posture seam (higher `detectability_active` + active posture/satellite multipliers).
    The `mobility`/`hardness` halves of the bias were ALREADY realized via the `MANEUVER_TYPE_MAP`
    profiles feeding the faithful detection/strike math (2b); posture was the missing piece. Pure data
    nudge — no detection-math edit. `ijfs_maneuver_posture_test.gd`. Golden UNCHANGED (turn-1 flags all
    false → all stay "hiding").
  - [x] **2d.** ✅ DONE 2026-06-29 — `GameState._apply_ijfs_maneuver_casualties()` (called after IJFS,
    before combat) decrements struck battalions' qty by `battalion_id`/`brigade_id`/`unit_type` (capped
    at 0; brigade marked destroyed when depleted). `ijfs_maneuver_consume_test.gd`. Golden UNCHANGED
    (struck units are BDE-269, not the golden BDE-66/BDE-77 combatants). **Closes the IJFS→ground
    linkage (port_audit ADAPT).** Limitation: ijfs_state built once/scenario so a removed battalion can
    re-appear as a target across many turns — qty cap keeps it safe (v1).
  Original item below: (`port_audit.md` "Ground-casualty IJFS↔OOB linkage".)
  Two halves: (a) **ID bridge** — ensure IJFS maneuver targets carry an OOB-matching `battalion_id`/
  `brigade_id` so `GameState._compute_ijfs_writeback` (`GameState.gd:547`) produces non-empty
  `maneuver_casualties`; (b) **consume** them — remove the struck battalions from the PLA/ROC OOB before
  ground combat resolves. Design settled **2026-06-28 (Option B + detectability)** — see `PLAN.md` Open
  Questions / `port_audit.md`; needs `moved_last_turn`/`fought_last_turn` on `Brigade`. Add gates.
  *Done when:* IJFS-destroyed maneuver battalions no longer fight in ground combat; deterministic; gate green.

- [x] **3. Balance sanity pass.** ✅ DONE 2026-06-30 (report-only) — `validate_headless_selfplay.gd`
  (4 turns) + temp 15-turn self-play, both deterministic/crash-free/index-clean. Reference policy never
  engages (combat_turns=0), so self-play doesn't exercise ground combat — but IJFS runs every turn, so
  the 2b–2d linkage IS exercised: Green maneuver battalions attrit 124→109 over 15 turns (~1/turn),
  deterministic, no runaway. Findings + future test-infra note (policy needs to actually fight) in
  `RETROSPECTIVES.md`. No rebalance.

## When the queue is exhausted (still green)
Pick the next highest-value **headless-gateable** item: ADAPT items from `port_audit.md` **only if** a
concrete balance need is evident (else skip — they're "tie to a need, not speculative"); otherwise take
a REFINE item from `docs/plans/refactor_audit.md` (e.g. victory census counts *present* not OOB
battalions; typed `HexState`/`CombatSummary`). Keep maximizing autonomy; keep the gate green.
